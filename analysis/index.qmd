# Analysis 

Current methods on measuring depth (bathymetry) includes surveys that use an echo sounder attached to a boat. 
However, such surveys require much time, money, and manpower, hence are usually restricted to a small scale. 
To determine bathymetry on a larger scale, remote sensing is adopted, but many techniques are based on how light 
reflects off the water surface, which is less accurate when measuring cloudy water bodies like the Amazon lakes. 

Considering the limitations of both methods, this project uses a new method involving flooding/ inundation frequency (IF), 
in other words, how often a certain part of a floodplain is flooded. As deeper parts of the floodplain would be 
flooded more, an IF-depth model can be used. This model is based on one of the floodplains called Curuai, 
which has been surveyed by a team of researchers, and is applied to the rest of the study area.
