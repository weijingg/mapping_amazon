Wetland extent data was obtained from the Oakland Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Centre (Hess et al., 2015).
The raster was cropped to along the middle-lower Amazon River and resampled to the inundation frequency (IF) raster's resolution. The raster 
contains information on wetland cover during both low-water and high-water stage in the Amazon, but because the IF-depth model is 
calibrated using survey data collected during the flooding season, the high-water stage wetland data was used to mask the IF data. 
For detailed code on how the raster was processed using **rasterio and rioxarray**, please refer to this 
[repository](https://github.com/musa-550-fall-2024/24fall-python-final-weijing_ang_proposal).

The vegetation cover in the middle-lower Amazon is diverse, ranging from aquatic macrophytes (herbaceous plants) 
that grow in or near the water, to forests that are annually submerged under 10 metres of water.
