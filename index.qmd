## Introduction

The middle-lower Amazon River has a complex morphology, where seasonal flooding has formed large floodplain lakes along the riverbanks.
The lakes regulate river flow, store nutrient-rich sediments and are home to diverse species. 
In this project, the depth of 12 lakes along the Amazon River were estimated using flooding frequency, where areas that flood more are expected to be deeper. 
Depth data is useful for research in ecology and hydrology, such as in determining biodiversity distribution and modelling water stratification.
