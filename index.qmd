The Amazon is the largest river in the world by discharge. 

The depth of 12 lakes along the Amazon River were mapped using a new method involving remote sensing and field surveys, with darker areas representing deeper waters. Depth data is useful for research in ecology and hydrology, such as in determining species distribution.
