## Overview

The middle-lower Amazon River has a complex morphology, where seasonal flooding has formed large floodplain lakes along the riverbanks.
The lakes regulate river flow, store nutrient-rich sediments and are home to diverse species. 
In this project, the depth of 12 lakes along the Amazon River was estimated using flooding frequency, with areas that flood more being expected to be deeper. 
Depth data is valuable for ecological and hydrological research, such as determining biodiversity distribution and modeling water stratification.
